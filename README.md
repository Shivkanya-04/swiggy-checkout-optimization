Swiggy Checkout Optimization — UX & Product Case Study
**Objective:** Redesign Swiggy’s checkout flow to improve transparency, reduce friction, and increase checkout completion rate.

**Overview**: This project analyzes Swiggy’s existing checkout experience, identifies seven critical UX issues, validates them with real user complaints and heuristic evaluation, and proposes a single-page redesigned checkout experience backed by user logic, business impact modeling, and technical feasibility.

**Key Problems Identified**
1. Unclear delivery & platform fees
2. Final invoice mismatch
3. Excessive cancellation penalties
4. Multi-step checkout (7–8 screens)
5. Non-sticky price summary
6. Repetitive address selection
7. Poor trust indicators

**User Evidence**
1. Screenshots of real complaints shared on Twitter:
2. Delivery fee charged despite Swiggy One
3. Invoice mismatch (charged vs. invoice total)
4. ₹5700 cancellation fee
5. Delivery ETA jump (40 mins → 115 mins)
6. Users threatening consumer court action

**Methodology**
1. Checkout teardown
2. Heuristic UX evaluation
3. Social media complaint analysis
4. Academic validation (Instamart case study)
5. Low-fidelity wireframing (Figma)
6. Competitor benchmarking (Zomato)
